BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:

zsdcc is included among the pre-built Windows and OSX binaries already.

* Configure the nirvana+ library

Edit file "z88dk/libsrc/_DEVELOPMENT/target/zx/config_nirvanap.m4"
Change "define(`__NIRVANAP_TOTAL_ROWS', 23)" to "define(`__NIRVANAP_TOTAL_ROWS', 18)‚Äù

You can also disable wide tiles from Nirvana by changing, to save 300 bytes aprox.

define(`__NIRVANAP_OPTIONS_WIDE_DRAW',    0x00)
define(`__NIRVANAP_OPTIONS_WIDE_SPRITES', 0x00)

To build the Pentagon version instead of the regular Spectrum version:

Edit file "z88dk/libsrc/_DEVELOPMENT/target/zx/config_target.m4"
Change "define(`__SPECTRUM', 1)" to "define(`__SPECTRUM', 32)"
